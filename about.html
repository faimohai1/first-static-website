								<p align="justify">
									Making the right choice of friends is very important for a person. Because, friends are the most likely to influence a person. It is eqally possible to be destroyed or be succeeded by the influence of friends for a man.  
								</p>
								<p align="justify">
									So, I'm very careful about making friends. And thus, my friendlist is not as long as others do.

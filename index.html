				<h2>Mission</h2>
					<img src="assets\images\mission.jpg" height="150" width="850">
					<p align="justify">
						My mission in life is not to live a calm life. I want it to be a vociferous one. I belive that, by taking up challenges, life can really be a colorful one. In this short life of 25 years since I've born on December 12,1994, I saw a lot of people taking up challenges often in their lives and be happy. On the other hand, I've also seen a lot of people not taking up challenges and live their lives in discontentment. 
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						So, to me living a happy life doesn't mean to survive in this world calmly even with great luxury! Instead of that, I like myself to be challenged and live a life full of adventure which exactly a web developer has.  
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						That's why I've made my mind to be a web developer and lead a challenging life full of joy and adventure of creating something new using my logic and creativity.  
					</p>
					<p align="justify"> 
						It can also be said in another way that I love creating new things and that's exactly what I can do by being a web developer and so, my mission is to become a web developer.</p>

				<h2>Vision</h2>
					<img src="assets\images\vision.jpg" height="150" width="850">
					<p>
						I've a dream. A big dream! I've a dream that doesn't allow me to sleep these days. To me,the system by which the world's currently being run, is not the system I prefer. I prefer a system that allows all the human beings to stand on the same row and without any inequality. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						To be exact, I want to change the world by doing something extraordinary with something which I  have pation and interest on. And by doing so I want to make the world a better one for living.
					</p>
					

				<h2> 10 Things I want in my Life </h2>
